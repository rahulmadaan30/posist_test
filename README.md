1. The application is written in java.
2. the library used includes the basic libraries for use of scanner class,string fuctions etc.
3. Crypto-js is file is used for SHA-256 encryption that provides us with a encryption algorithm which of the most difficult             algorithms to decrypt currently being used by NSA this ensures security and is also being used in blockchain and honestly i do not know much about encryption and decrytion.  

Functionalities:
1.genesisblockcreation.

2.returning node for a specific index

3.returning current node

4.adding nodes

5.checking immutability

6.editvalue of node

7.print longest chain from genesis node

8.encryption using hash value

9.longest chain from any particular node

10.merge data from 2 nodes and calculate new hash value.
